--------

PHP 5.2+ API for interacting with Amazon's API. Very basic, and designed
to work dynamically with Amazon's API, so any updates Amazon does should just work
since the function is dynamically generated using PHP's __call() feature.

The Amazon API list is here:

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/2010-09-01/DG/CHAP_OperationListAlphabetical.html

For instance, ItemSearch, so you call the function ItemSearch(), and pass 
any parameters to it in an array.

Usage:
--------

$amz = new AmazonProductLookup('YOUR AWS KEY', 'YOUR SECRET KEY');
$results = $amz->ItemSearch(array('SearchIndex'=>'Apparel', 'Keywords' => 'Shirt'));

$results is a SimpleXML object. You can also return a JSON string by calling:

$amz->setJSON(true);
